The Kaizen principle is to endeavor to create tiny incremental improvements in your daily life with an aim for mastery over performance, while forsaking external comparisons, unless such comparisons inspire.

The key operands are: 
1. Tiny incremental improvements
2. Mastery over performance
3. External comparisons
